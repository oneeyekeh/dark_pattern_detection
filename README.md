# dark_pattern_detection
This research explores the textual and visual detection of dark patterns on e-commerce websites using large language models and image recognition, building on the foundational work of Arunesh Mathurâ€™s taxonomy from the Dark Patterns at Scale paper published in 2019. The study has two main outcomes: first, the development of an open-source Chrome extension that enables users to identify dark patterns during their browsing experience, and second, the execution of detection on a dataset of 146 e-commerce websites. This analysis uncovers current manipulative trends across various dark pattern categories and it provides implications for designers advocating for greater awareness to combat deceptive practices in e-commerce websites.
